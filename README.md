# Date Night Recipes

This app is a different twist on the well-known "Netflix & Chill" idea. Start by simply entering some basic information, including your zip code. Then, you'll be prompted to select the moive you'd like to watch. After selecting your movie, you will be provided with a selection of up to 5 local restaurants that we think will "pair" well with your movie selection.

## Tech Stack
